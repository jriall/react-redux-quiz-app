# Capital Cities Quiz App

https://jamesriall.co.uk/react-redux-quiz-app/

## The Project

A multiple choice quiz app using React and Redux which allows a user to be presented with a series of 10 questions testing their knowledge of capital cities. Users have the option to select whether they want to answer which country a given capital city is in, or which city is the capital of a given country. After answering each of the 10 questions, the app tells the player whether they were right or wrong (and if wrong, what the correct answer is), and also displays to the user a map showing the location of the city and country. The app keeps track of the users score as well as the current question the users is on and displays a final score and congratulations (or commiserations) message at the end of the game.
